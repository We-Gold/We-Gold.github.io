I'm a senior at Hershey High School! I do lots of coding on my own time, and I am the head programmer on my robotics team, [@FRC2539](https://github.com/FRC2539).

While I am fascinated by all things programming, I have a particular love for code that incorporates or implements biological ideas, such as AI and biological simulations.
