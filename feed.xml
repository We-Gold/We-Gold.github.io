<p>I was required to create a dodecahedron, and the following was my interpretation (Mine being the left, the real one being the right). I chose this mainly for the reason that Sputnik was the first satellite, which aligns with my interest in space. Because Sputnik was a satellite, that gave me room to add features, for example the lights on the top.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbbsqdv01">Music</h2>
<p>I recommend listening to music while reading. It may slightly decrease your comprehention, but it does make you love the experience a lot more.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/49524163&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbblvle91">Electronics?</h2>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://we-gold.github.io/media/posts/1/Sputnik-Circuitry.JPG" alt="" width="494" height="503"></p>
<p>The electronics of this system are very simple. The simplest explanation is that the power from the battery is not connected to the lights until the switch is flipped. Then, when the switch is flipped, it creates a connection between the battery and the lights, causing them to turn on.</p>
<p>The lower level explanation goes as follows:</p>
<p>The power is coming from a 9 volt battery, which is acceptable for this application. It doesn't have the equivalent capacity of six AA or AAA (both 1.5 volt) batteries, but there is low power usage in this case (LEDs require little power), which makes it fine for this use.</p>
<p>The LEDs' cathodes (negative side and shorter wire) are soldered to a common point, which has one wire coming out for a connection. This allows them all to be connected to the same negative more efficiently. The common wire is then soldered to the wire from the negative of the 9 volt battery.</p>
<p>The LEDs' anodes (positive side and longer wire) are also soldered to a common wire, making it simpler for a connection. This will result in an easier connection process. The common wire is then soldered to a pin (not a middle pin) on the switch (<strong>not</strong> a temporary switch). </p>
<p>A 1k Ohm resistor is then soldered to an adjacent middle pin to the anode wire. The other side of the resistor is soldered to the positive wire from the battery. </p>
<p>The final step is to add liquid electrical tape (or another similar material) in order to prevent wires from randomly touching and short circuiting the battery.</p>
<p>That completes the circuit!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbbmr7g72">The construction of a dodecahedron</h2>
<p>To construct a pentagon, you can follow the gif below (if this doesn't work for you, that is fine. You can always use another tutorial). For this you will need a compass (geometry tool), a straightedge, and a pencil. If you are rusty on you construction technique, you can find many great videos on YouTube to catch up with. <em>If you choose to print a net from online, just note that that takes some of the fun out of this process.</em><br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://we-gold.github.io/media/posts/1/Regular_Pentagon_Using_Carlyle_Circle.gif" width="375" height="375"></p>
<p>Next, you want to draw the diagonals of the pentagon. That will leave you with this:</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://we-gold.github.io/media/posts/1/pentagon-with-diagonals.PNG" alt="" width="219" height="207"></p>
<p>Now, you can finish it off with a few more lines to make one net.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://we-gold.github.io/media/posts/1/full-net.PNG" alt="" width="206" height="200"></p>
<p>This is the final net for one side (if you do it by hand, your result should be better than mine done on the computer). This net contains six pentagons, and places to cut for tabs. You will also need tabs on the two outside edges of the outside pentagons.</p>
<p>This net is only one side, so you will need two of these, and then you make the cuts necessary to have tabs on the outside. </p>
<p>Do not glue this yet, because you need to add some color to the outside!! From here you can take any creative liberties you want.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dbbp4n205">Final Steps</h2>
<p>The electronics need to be put into the dodecahedron. To do that, cut some holes in the top for the LEDs and one large one for the switch. Put the electronics through, and secure them. Then, put the wires and battery inside and finish the dodecahedron by glueing the tabs together.</p>
<p>Finally, add some extra touches like adding the legs that come off of sputnik!</p>
<p>I'd love to see some of your results in the comments below. You can post images in there!</p>
